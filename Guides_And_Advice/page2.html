<!-- The two main parts are the heading and body-->

<!-- The heading does not effect any of the content on the screen-->

    <head>
<!-- We use title here to specify the TAB name of our webpage. 
      Title also represents the name of the website given in Search 
      results to the web user-->

<!-- The meta tag means extra information. There are a lot of 
        meta tags but the most important is the charset-->
<!-- utf-8 is the standard on all webpages today-->
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title> Page 2 </title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>

<!-- The body effects the content of the web page-->

    <body>
<!-- Note that browsers ignore empty space. The first space counts
    and every space afterwords does not count-->

    <!-- p means a paragraph. Only p means paragrah. THERE IS 
        NO NUMBER ASSOCIATED WITH A PARAGRAPH TAG-->

    <p> Page 2 text. </p>
    <p>A bunch of newwww text</p>
                    
    <!-- There are six diffrent types of headings h1-h6-->
    <!-- h1 will be the biggest while h6 is the smallest heading-->
    <!-- Note that web browsers denote bigger headings as more important
        information than a smaller heading-->

    <h1> Heading 1</h1>
    <h6> Heading 6</h6>
    <!-- To make text bold use the strong tag. If the strong tag 
        does not conclude then everything after the tag will be bold-->
    <p><strong>This text is bold.</strong> Not bold anymore</p>

    <!-- To make italics we use the em tag (em stands for emphasis)-->
    <p> <em> Here is some italic text.</em> This text is not italic anymore</p>

    <!-- We can also combine tags. For instance: we want bold and italics-->
    <!-- The tags <b> and <i> mean bold and italics respectively but b AND i DO NOT CHANGE THE IMPORTANCE
        OF THE TEXT WHICH IS BAD for ACCESSIBILITY SUPPORT-->
    <p> <em><strong> This text will be bold and italics</strong></em></p>

        <!-- The <a> tag means a link tag. Specifically a stands for anchor-->
         <!-- Without extra information the <a> tag does nothing-->   
             <!-- The http is required for the link to work. This kind of http link is known
                as an absolute link. However we can use relative links. Such as for acessing
                another page of our site -->
