<html>
<!-- The two main parts are the heading and body-->

<!-- The heading does not effect any of the content on the screen-->

    <head>
<!-- We use title here to specify the TAB name of our webpage. 
      Title also represents the name of the website given in Search 
      results to the web user-->

<!-- The meta tag means extra information. There are a lot of 
        meta tags but the most important is the charset-->
<!-- utf-8 is the standard on all webpages today-->
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title> Generic Website name </title>
<!-- To use an external css file we need to link it. We link the css file in
    the head and not the body-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>

<!-- The body effects the content of the web page-->

   
<!-- Note that browsers ignore empty space. The first space counts
    and every space afterwords does not count-->

    <!-- p means a paragraph. Only p means paragrah. THERE IS 
        NO NUMBER ASSOCIATED WITH A PARAGRAPH TAG-->


    <!-- We can use the word style to write css in our html files-->
    <!-- The ; in css means the end of the statement-->
    <!-- It is better practice to use the hex values of colors-->
    <!-- The advantage of css is that it cascades. Meaning it effects everything going down-->
    <!-- For instance say we want the entire site to have a blue background-->
    <!-- Another great thing with css is that we can overwrite styles for diffrent sections-->
    <body>
    <h1> Some Red Text</h1>
    <p One line of text. </p>
    <p>A bunch of extra text</p>

    <!-- There are six diffrent types of headings h1-h6-->
    <!-- h1 will be the biggest while h6 is the smallest heading-->
    <!-- Note that web browsers denote bigger headings as more important
        information than a smaller heading-->

    <h1> Heading 1</h1>
    <h6> Heading 6</h6>
    <!-- To make text bold use the strong tag. If the strong tag 
        does not conclude then everything after the tag will be bold-->
    <p><strong>This text is bold.</strong> Not bold anymore</p>

    <!-- To make italics we use the em tag (em stands for emphasis)-->
    <p> <em> Here is some italic text.</em> This text is not italic anymore</p>

    <!-- We can also combine tags. For instance: we want bold and italics-->
    <!-- The tags <b> and <i> mean bold and italics respectively but b AND i DO NOT CHANGE THE IMPORTANCE
        OF THE TEXT WHICH IS BAD for ACCESSIBILITY SUPPORT-->
    <p> <em><strong> This text will be bold and italics</strong></em></p>

        <!-- The <a> tag means a link tag. Specifically a stands for anchor-->
         <!-- Without extra information the <a> tag does nothing-->   
             <!-- The http is required for the link to work. This kind of http link is known
                as an absolute link. However we can use relative links. Such as for acessing
                another page of our site -->
            <a href="http://www.google.com"> This link will take us to google.com</a>
                <!-- This is a relative hyper link text refrence to the page2.html page located in 
                    the same directory as this file-->
            <p><a href="page2.html"> This link will go to page 2  </a> </p> 
      
                    <!-- <img> is the tag to add images to our site-->
                    <!-- To use images from a website we need an http source. This is called the src-->
                    <img src="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpixabay.com%2Fimages%2Fsearch%2Fnature%2F&psig=AOvVaw18hGEYZ-cOoZz285GkwRak&ust=1621463386940000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCMixsfuj1PACFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD" alt="A sunset picture that will never load">
                    <!--When the picture is not found we see a picture icon indicated no picture loaded-->
                    <!-- Notice that an img tag does not end-->
                    <!-- Here is an image found on my computer-->
                    <!-- FOR AN IMAGE TO BE VALID: you need to add the alternate text
                        which is simply an explanation of your picture-->
                    <!-- alt text is needed for accessiblity purposes-->
                    <!-- Note that you can add a / at the end of the image. But html 5 does not need this to work-->
                    <img src="../images/MeAtStoneMountain.jpg" alt="a picture of me at stone mountain"/>

<!-- Tips for File structure-->
<!-- For handling file structure it is best to keep the html files in the main directory-->
<!-- You should use an img folder-->
<!-- You should use lower case on all items you add otherwise there may be wierd issues-->
<!-- You should never use spaces for any of your files-->
<!-- You should avoid numbers or any wierd symmbols-->
